# echo-explorer
A time capsule for a project codenamed "Echo Explorer"<br />
<br />
This idea is similar to an idea I had myself for a puzzle platformer game where your character is invisible in the dark but visible when cast on by light.<br />
The difference here is that the challenge changes from you being invisible to the environment and instead of using light to see it, you use soundwaves.<br />
This is going to be a horror puzzle game based off of echolocation and being a blind prey trying to survive in the wild.<br />
You will play as a prey animal (possibly tenrec) trying to avoid threats such as predators and dealing with obstacles such as rain making your echolocation worse.
